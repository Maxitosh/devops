# Best practices for Python and Markdown

## Python

### Web frameworks

* [Gunicorn](https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/) - is a Python WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX.
* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) - is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and
  clean, pragmatic design.
* [web2py](https://www.web2py.com/) - free open source full-stack framework for rapid development of fast, scalable,
  secure and portable database-driven web-based applications.
* [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) - is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. It is designed to
  make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. It began as a simple
  wrapper around Werkzeug and Jinja.
* [**FastAPI**](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.
### Linters

* [**Pylint**](http://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/) - checks for errors, tries to enforce a coding standard
* [PyFlakes](https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes) - analyzes programs and detects various errors
* [pycodestyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle) - checks against style conventions in PEP 8
* [pydocstyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pydocstyle) - checks compliance with Python docstring conventions
* [Bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - analyzes code to find common security issues
* [MyPy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - checks for optionally-enforced static types

### Formatters and analyzers

* [**Black**](https://github.com/psf/black) - formats Python code without compromise
* [Radon](https://radon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - analyzes code for various metrics (lines of code, complexity, and
  so on)
* [Isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort) - formats imports by sorting alphabetically and separating into sections

## Markdown

* [**Markdown Lint**](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint) - node.js markdown linter that is easy to install and
  easy to customize.
* [mdspell](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-spellcheck) - is a tool specifically for spelling checking markdown
  documents.
* [alex](https://alexjs.com/) - catches insensitive and inconsiderate writing, it supports markdown files.
* [write-good](https://github.com/btford/write-good) - the toolâ€™s focus is on improving the clarity of writing.
* [textlint](https://textlint.github.io/) - is a pluggable linting tool that supports markdown, plain text, and HTML.
* [proselint](http://proselint.com/) - goes deep on writing clarity improvements.
