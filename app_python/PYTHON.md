# Best practices for Python and Markdown

## Python

### Linters

* [Pylint](http://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/) - checks for errors, tries to enforce a coding standard
* [PyFlakes](https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes) - analyzes programs and detects various errors
* [pycodestyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle) - checks against style conventions in PEP 8
* [pydocstyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pydocstyle) - checks compliance with Python docstring conventions
* [Bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - analyzes code to find common security issues
* [MyPy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - checks for optionally-enforced static types

### Formatters and analyzers

* [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) - formats Python code without compromise
* [Radon](https://radon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - analyzes code for various metrics (lines of code, complexity, and
  so on)
* [Isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort) - formats imports by sorting alphabetically and separating into sections

## Markdown

* [Markdown Lint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint) - node.js markdown linter that is easy to install and easy
  to customize.
* [mdspell](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-spellcheck) - is a tool specifically for spelling checking markdown
  documents.

* [write-good](https://github.com/btford/write-good) - the toolâ€™s focus is on improving the clarity of writing.
* [textlint](https://textlint.github.io/) - is a pluggable linting tool that supports markdown, plain text, and HTML.
